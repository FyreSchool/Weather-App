# Overview

This program is a basic weather app that will tell the current weather of a location along with the forecast for the next three days. The location is specified with a search bar that the user can input the city of their choice. This was a really fun project to work on since I havenâ€™t touched JavaScript in a few years, and it was a great refresher into the language. For this program I also wanted to make a program that was not just run in the terminal, so I wanted to use HTML to display the weather information. I had never used HTML before in a project and after reading a few tutorials and asking ChatGPT a few questions I was able to get the program working with HTML. I definitely look forward to trying to code a few more projects in JavaScript and implementing them with HTML.
